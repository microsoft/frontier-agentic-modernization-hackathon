# Challenge 01 — Assess the eShopOnWeb Application

## Introduction

A common misconception is that an application already running on ASP.NET Core does not need a formal assessment before upgrading — "it's already modern, just bump the version." This challenge will prove that assumption wrong.

**eShopOnWeb** runs on ASP.NET Core 8.0, uses Central Package Management across five projects, and has a Blazor WebAssembly admin area. Moving to .NET 10 involves breaking API changes, package compatibility issues, and a significant OpenAPI tooling change that affects every consumer of the PublicApi project.

The GitHub Copilot Modernization tool provides a `modernize assess` command that analyses your codebase and produces a structured report. Understanding this report is the foundation for every subsequent challenge.

## Description

Run the GitHub Copilot Modernization assessment on the eShopOnWeb application:

- Assess the application: `Student/Resources/net8/eShopOnWeb`

Review the generated assessment report and discuss as a team:

- Which NuGet packages are flagged as requiring a version bump or as incompatible with .NET 10?
- Is **Swashbuckle** identified as a concern? Why is it a problem in .NET 9+?
- What does the report say about the **Blazor WebAssembly** project (`BlazorAdmin`)?
- Are there any **EF Core** breaking changes flagged?
- What is the recommended migration target runtime and framework version?
- Which issues can the `modernize` tool fix automatically vs. which require manual intervention?

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, demonstrate:

1. An assessment report exists for the eShopOnWeb application
2. Your team can articulate the **top 3 migration blockers** (packages, APIs, or patterns that require manual attention)
3. Your team has identified that **Swashbuckle** must be replaced and can explain why
4. Your team has confirmed which of the five projects (`Web`, `PublicApi`, `Infrastructure`, `ApplicationCore`, `BlazorAdmin`) require changes and of what kind
5. **Explain to your coach** — what is `Directory.Packages.props` and why does centralising package versions make the .NET 10 upgrade both easier and potentially more dangerous than upgrading each project individually?

## Tips

- Run the assessment from inside the `eShopOnWeb` folder: `cd Student/Resources/net8/eShopOnWeb && modernize assess`
- Pay special attention to findings tagged **Critical** — these will block a successful `dotnet build` after the Target Framework Moniker bump.
- The `Directory.Packages.props` file is the single source of truth for all package versions in this repo — changing `<TargetFramework>` there affects all five projects simultaneously.
